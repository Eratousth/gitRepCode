/*
Hello! This is a small game called October Hunt. 

The objective of the game is to reach a hidden treasure on the map.
When you find the treasure the win counter goes up, meaning you gained a point!
There is an aid in the form of a little indicator saying how far you are from the treasure
but it does not say the direction.

Controls:
w - Up
s - Down
a - Left
d - Right

e - exits the game
